This is a test project I had to create to pass the final step interview in TOPTAL in 2016.

The project structure:
1) The backend is created on ASP.NET WebAPI
2) The frontend is created as single page application using AngularJs
3) There are some end-2-end tests created with protractor
4) There are some backend unit tests created with MS Tests framework and Moq
